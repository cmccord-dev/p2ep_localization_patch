# p2ep_localization_patch

This is only a beta.  It works so far with the testing we've done but it's a large game so it's entirely possible we've missed something.  Save often.

You can apply the patch using http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/598/ or your favorite xdelta patcher.
I chose xdelta because the compressed nature of the games files results in very large patch sizes for other patch types.  

Works on SLUS_011.58

MD5: 32E245A231F145587085F947F8634145

The p2ep_localization_patch_jp version works for the undub patched version of the game with MD5 9d5e6eba1a4ea1fff4011e85a0a80878
